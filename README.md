The website is a one stop information system for all Covid related resources and guidelines. Made using HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Node.js and MongoDB, the website utilizes APIs to fetch information and display statistics on the number of active cases, total deaths, vaccinations and state wise helpline numbers. Hosted using the heroku app, this website is an attempt to help the general population be more aware of the situation of Covid in the country and find resources to seek help.
